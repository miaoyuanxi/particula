# Recursive Voronoi

Welcome! In this quick video I walk you through this simple setup where we wrap a fracturing procedure inside a loop to have it repeat countless times. There are a few interesting bits on how to work with for-each and for loops, and I hope you can learn something from it.

Going in a bit more detail, the combination of functions I used on the Scatter node is super useful and I use these types of things all the time. Quick if statements are an essential tool to have on your belt, and they allow you to create pretty complex logic. It basically evaluates the first argument, which in our case was a comparison between the iteration value and an integer. If the argument turns out to be true, the second argument will be then used, otherwise the third is spit out.

See the documentation for more details.

Just as mentioned in the video, the scene file goes one step further and prepares the geometry for rendering, after adding some noise displacement. Here is the link for downloading it if youâ€™re interested.
