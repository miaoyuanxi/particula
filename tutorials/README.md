# [Procedural Scatter](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/procedural_scatter)

This write-up is divided into two parts. First we take a look at how to export multiple pieces of geometry most efficiently as sequence files. Later we go through building a small network that procedurally checks for inputs on disk and randomly pick items.

# Shortest Paths

# Procedural Modules

# Recursive Voronoi

# Unconventional k-d tree partitioning algorithm
