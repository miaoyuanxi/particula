Landing page for long-form tutorials/write-ups/walkthroughs of some more specific subjects.

Some of these have their own Youtube videos that I'd also recommend watching.

### [Interactive Python States](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/interactive_python_states)!

![ips](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81909946/113515027-41f02680-9572-11eb-9030-8ad2955e96de.jpg)

In this video we take a look at python viewer states inside Houdini 18, and how its practicality can help technical artists develop interactive, easy-to-use tools for fast and smart content creation.

### [Procedural Scatter](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/procedural_scatter)

This write-up is divided into two parts. First we take a look at how to export multiple pieces of geometry most efficiently as sequence files. Later we go through building a small network that procedurally checks for inputs on disk and randomly pick items.

### Shortest Paths

### Procedural Modules

### Recursive Voronoi

### Unconventional k-d tree partitioning algorithm
