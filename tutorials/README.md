In this video we take a look at python viewer states inside Houdini 18, and how its practicality can help technical artists develop interactive, easy-to-use tools for fast and smart content creation.

# Procedural Scatter

This write-up is divided into two parts. First we take a look at how to export multiple pieces of geometry most efficiently as sequence files. Later we go through building a small network that procedurally checks for inputs on disk and randomly pick items.

# Shortest Paths

[![Shortest Paths](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81909946/113515536-60a3ec80-9575-11eb-8ebd-713ad3aced19.jpg)](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/shortest_paths)

I was wondering for a while simple ways on how to generate roots or veins structures that possibly didnâ€™t rely on solvers. There is a very interesting node in Houdini called FindShortestPath which will basically search for the most optimal path between one or multiple start and end points on a given mesh.
