# About

    /parˈti.ku.la/; diminutive of pars (‘part, piece’); small part, particle.

Slow and steady. Small bits that are constantly flocking; just like particles, knowledge can be seen as a bunch of tiny blocks being stacked on top of each other. The larger the foundation, the higher the threshold.

I realized that one of the greatest ways of learning anything is by teaching, even if sometimes the audience is yourself. I also discovered that I enjoy recording walkthroughs of some techniques I’ve been using and developing while learning and working with Houdini, and there are probably people out there that would be interested in them too.

Created by Ricardo Ponce, Particula was born from a collection of personal annotations and experiences that were begging to be compiled somewhere. Sharing Houdini scene files, insights into digital assets development, and publishing my adventures related to this incredible piece of software are my main purposes. I have a huge range of interests within all that Houdini can offer (a list that seems to grow constantly), however designing things procedurally is something that I always strive for.

A wise friend once told me knowledge should never be dammed (nor damned, for that matter). By withholding it you stagnate, hence cannot evolve.
